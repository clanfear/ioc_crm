OUTLINE

Basic logistics for the course

A hook illustrating research approaches

Some Logistics

# An Extended Example


Serious crime like robbery seems to be more likely to occur where there is disorder—litter on the ground, panhandlers in the street, and youths loitering on the corner.

--

The broken windows thesis:

* Potential offenders interpet disorder as a sign of low social control

   * If no one stops litter and panhandling, no one will stop robbery or drug dealing

--

* Consequently, disorder emboldens them to commit crime.

--

*How might we test that?*

---
# An Experiment

--

.pull-left[

Keizer et al. (2008):

* Leave a money-filled envelope dangling from a postbox

* See if people steal it

* Add and remove disorder and see if the rate of theft changes

]
.pull-right[

]

--

They found disorder increased theft (and other antisocial behaviour).^[Though this hasn't been found in replications.]


---
# Observational

Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999):

*What if this relationship is false because social structure causes both disorder and crime?*

--

.pull-left[
* Obtain "objective" measures of neighborhood disorder in 80 neighborhoods in Chicago

* Obtain measures of social control

* See if disorder predicts crime in neighborhoods that are otherwise *similar*
]
.pull-right[

]

--

Result:

* No disorder to crime relationship 

* Disorder and crime both determined by social control

---
# Interviews

* Keizer et al. (2008) and Sampson &amp; Raudenbush (1999) focus on level of disorder and rates of crime but not the *mechanism* linking them.

* Broken windows says potential offenders *interpret* disorder as a signal of low social control.

--
.pull-left[
St. Jean (2007):

* Ask robbers and drug dealers how they interpret disorder (and social control)

* Ask why they commit crime where they do
]
.pull-right[
BOOK COVER
]

--

Results:

* Offenders don't care about disorder

* Only sometimes care about social control

* Sensitive mainly to *opportunity*, which sometimes co-occurs with disorder---but sometimes not.

---
# This Course

There are many approaches to answer similar questions

--

This course is mainly about **methodology**---the theory and process of choosing how to answer a research question

--

We'll talk about **methods** some too---these are techniques

* IQA is methods for quantitative
* SSRMC offers both quantitative and qualitative methods courses

--

While they're embedded in methodology, we will not talk much about:

* Epistemology
* Ontology

These shape how you (and I) think about methodology

---
# My Approach

First half of this course emphasizes **causality**

* Does `\(x\)` make `\(y\)` happen

--

* Causal approaches typically occupy a hypothetico-deductive framework

--

* But methods not necessarily quantitative, and observations not necessarily physical, behavioural, or even observable:

   * *Meanings* can be cause actions

   * Experiences can generate *meanings*

???

My own theoretical work drags routine activity and ecological theories kicking and screaming into what Bottoms calls active-subject socially-oriented criminology—but my approach is generally quantitative.

--

* Causal 


Social science theories are causal systems

Testing theory is causal research



---

# Course Goals

* Understand what research is and how it is done

   * Major research traditions in criminology

   * Principles of research design

# Joining a conversation

Criminology is an ongoing conversation

--

To participate, you need to know:

* What the conversation is about
* What the current state is
* What its premises are

--

Joining the conversation requires understanding of theories and methodology

--

* This course is about methodology---and a bit of methods

   * Methodology is theory about how research questions are answered
   * It guides our choice of methods, the techniques and procedures used to conduct research


---

# Criminological Research

Social science research is about understanding how the world works

--

For criminologists, it typically has to do specifically with...

--

* Criminal Law (e.g., definitions of crime)

--

* Causes of crime (e.g., opportunity)

--

* Consequences of crime (e.g., victimizaton)

--

* Responses to crime (e.g., policing and incarceration)

---

# Good questions

* Are answerable&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

--

* Improve our understanding of the world

   * That is, they inform **theory**

.footnote[[1] What answerable *means* is subject to epistemological debate.]

--

Good research design is that which can answer good research questions

--

Empirical research uses observations from the world

---
# Sources of Questions

* Theory

   * We have expectations---are they correct?
   * Often theories offer differing expectations
      * Adjudication makes for compelling questions!

--

* Ignorance

   * We have no expectations
   * True ignorance is much rarer than being poorly read&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.footnote[[1] Criminology, like other social sciences, is plagued with reinvention of the wheel.]

--

*In both cases, you're probably going to need to read a lot.*

---

# Who produces data on crime and criminal justice?

* Academic researchers

* Contract researchers

* Government and related departments

   * Ministry of Justice
   * Home Office,
   * Youth Justice Board
   * Inspectorates

* Campaign Organisations

   * Prison Reform Trust
   * Howard League

---

# What knowledge is generated?

* Descriptive statistics

* Risk and protective factors 

* Explanations / Explanatory Frameworks

* Descriptions

* Interpretations

* Critiques

---

&gt; Expert, research-based knowledge about crime and criminals
still competes with views of the subject which are not
‘criminological’ in their style of reasoning or their use of
evidence. Judges, moralists, religious fundamentalists, and
populist leader-writers still offer views on criminological
subjects which are quite innocent of criminological science.
Unlike physics or even economics, which have established a
degree of monopoly over the right to speak authoritatively
about their subjects, criminology operates in a culture which
combines traditional and scientific modes of thought and
action. Intuitive, ‘instinctive’, common-sense views about
crime and criminals are still more persuasive to many –
including many in positions of power and authority – than
are the results of carefully executed empirical research’
(Garland, 2002:23)

---

# How can we understand the social world?

---

# Criminological research

* Research on incidence and distribution of criminal behaviour

* Inquiries about the causes or correlates of criminal coduct

* Clinical studies of individual delinquents

* Ethnographies of deviant groups

* Penological studies

* Victim studies

* The monitoring and evaluation of criminal justice agencies

* Prediction of future criminal conduct

* Study of processes of social reaction

* Historical work on changing patterns of crime and control

---

# Types of Research

1. Description (‘what is the extent of this thing? What does
this look like?’): e.g. how many children experience
parental imprisonment? At what ages? What happens
when they go to visit their parent in prison?)

2. Exploration/ interpretation (‘what is going on here?) e.g.
How do children experience the imprisonment of a
parent? (What does it feel like? Stigmatising?
Embarrassing? A relief?) What meanings do children
attach to the parent’s imprisonment?

3. Explanation (‘what explains, predicts, accounts for?’) Why
do some children adapt relatively well to parental
imprisonment and others do not?

4. Evaluation (‘what works / what impact?’: e.g. how does
an intervention support resettlement of imprisoned
fathers with their families (and why?)

Note that almost any topic could be studied in any of these
ways.

---

# Descriptive Research

– Extent of an issue / prevalence of an issue
• How many prisoners have mental health
problems?
• How many probation staff say that their
morale is affected by having to fulfil targets?
– The process of something
• E.g. What are the dynamics of court cases?
Who does what, at what point?
– The experience of something
• How do female prisoners experience release,
and what are the biggest hurdles in

---

# Exploratory and interpretive research

• Exploratory research - when there is little
existing data– aim is to build insight into a
phenomenon, (sometimes in order to develop
research questions for more focussed research)
• Often, few expectations about what you might
find (i.e. No ‘hypotheses’ or highly specific
research questions).
• Usually this will also be fairly descriptive
research, but will include some attempt to
‘understand’, ‘interpret’ or ‘explain’
(subjectively) the phenomenon, i.e. How and
why do prisoners women use drugs: what does
it mean to them? what does it do for them?

---

# Explanatory Research

• Deductive
– Starting with an explanation or
theory and collecting data to test it.
– E.g. Labeling Theory: Empirical Tests
(Farrington and Murray, 2014)
• Inductive
– Exploratory. Developing the
explanation from the data
collected.
– Why do victims often not press
charges in cases of domestic
violence? (Bennett, Goodman and
Dutton, 1999)

---

# Predictive Research

• E.g. using existing data (e.g.
characteristics of cases) to predict
an outcome
• E.g. forecasting of domestic
violence or prisoner resettlement.
• Longitudinal and prospective
research studies e.g Cambridge
Study for Delinquency
Development, Families and
Imprisonment Research Study.

---

# Evaluation research

• Is intervention X effective?
• Even if you can answer this question, you still
might not be able to explain why
– E.g. Minneapolis DV Experiments: arrest
worked in reducing domestic violence
– Replication studies: arrest worked in some
cases, but not others
– Why? Research was not set up to study this.
• Explanatory research is usually done AFTER or AS
PART of evaluation research, using interviews and
observations (‘what did people say about what
was going on?’), or secondary data analysis (‘were
there differences between the groups that might
help us understand the results?)
• Problem: if something was not considered
important in the first place, there might not be any
data on it. Often this results new studies, to test
the new explanation.

# On research and theory

“Theory is never completely isolated
from problems of empirical research,
any more than empirical research is
free from theoretical assumptions”
Layder (1994: vi)

“Theory is inextricably involved in
the process of data-gathering and
data-interpretation” Bottoms
(2007: 75)

---

(Image from Bottoms (2008:93) on positive and negative features of five approaches to criminology)

---

# Research Approaches

Theoretical Perspective
(view of the world and
social life within it)

e.g.
Positivism
Post-positivism
Interpretivism
(e.g. symbolic
interactionism,
phenomenology,
hermeneutics)
Constructivism
Critical Inquiry
Feminism
Postmodernism
Pragmatism


Methodology
(strategy or plan of action)

Quantitative or qualitative
e.g.
(Quasi) experiments
Surveys
Ethnography
Grounded Theory
Action Research
Discourse Analysis
Case study
Oral History

Methods
(techniques and procedures for
collecting and analysing data)

e.g.
Interviews
Focus Groups
Observations
Visual methods
Secondary Data Analysis
Documentary Analysis
Questionnaires

---

# Qualitative and quantitative research methodologies

### Distinct but complementary

---

# Quantitative research methodology

* Has philosophical roots in positivism (and post-positivism) and the natural
sciences

* Sharp distinction between scientific issues and statements and normative
ones

* Focus on explanation, prediction, cause and effect

* Interest in ‘laws’, general cases, patterns, generalisations…

* Deductive analysis

---

# Examples of quantitative methods

* Survey analysis
* Experiments and quasi-experiments
* Psychometrics
* Text mining
* Meta-analyses

---

# Qualitative research methodology

* Focus on interpretation: how reality is understood and constructed by
individuals/groups in social settings; how power is exercised

* Approaches to research which prioritise the interpretations of actions and meanings
over measurement and prediction

* Aims to produce contextual/ideographic understandings (rather than nomothetic)

(I'd disagree with this---maybe an emphasis but not overall aim)

* Philosophically rooted in a broadly interpretivist and constructivist positions

* Based on flexible methods of data generation

* Inductive and deductive analysis

---

# Examples of qualitative methods

* Interviews
* Ethnography and participant observation
* Focus groups
* Document and discourse analysis
* Case studies

---

# Mixed Methods Research

Research in which the investigator collects and analyses
data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using
both qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods
in a single study or program of inquiry’ Tashakkori and
Creswell (2007:4)

Mixing approaches and methods is very common (real
world research…)

an intellectual and practical synthesis

‘qualitative knowing’ about a setting may help to make
sense of patterns in observations or statistical data;
qualitative data analysis may help guide the formulation
of hypotheses to be tested

---

# Limits of using single approaches?
• The need for a full
‘methodological
toolbox’
• Use the tool
appropriate to the
research
topic/questions

---

# Truths and Representations

Most research studies in the social sciences involve
rather abstract concepts or constructs devised by
the researcher or other members of the
discipline, like intelligence, wealth, class, social
mobility, knowledge of a language. This means
that to investigate a problem, based on an
abstract idea, a way of measuring that idea is
going to be required. This will mean devising or
selecting a measuring ‘instrument’ that will
constitute an operational (observable) definition
of this abstraction” (Black, 1993:14-15)

“Without the ‘correcting influence’ of
ethnographic or participant observation
approaches, it is all too easy for those studying
crime to lose their sense of reality and begin to
perceive offenders not as people, but merely as
‘problems’ or ‘numbers’” (Maguire, 2007: 149)

“Curiosity has itself to be
under scrutiny while being
exercised; we must not be
directed towards
understanding other
problems by inhibiting
observation of our own
curiosity” (Bion, 1976)

---

# Hierarchies of Knowledge

“In any system of ranked groups, participants take it
as given that members of the highest group have the
right to define the way things really are. And since …
matters of rank and status are contained in the
mores, this belief has a moral quality. … Thus,
credibility and the right to be heard are differently
distributed through the ranks of the system”
(Becker, 1967: 241)

---

# Thinking about Research Quality

The Research Aims

How well does the author
convince of the relevance and
topicality of the research?

Does it have relevance for
theoretical understanding/
policy development/practice?

How well will the study
contribute to existing
research knowledge?

---

# Research Questions/Hypotheses

What are the key research questions/
hypotheses?

How well are they justified? Do they respond
to gaps in/or developing
theory/policy/practice?

How clearly are the key concepts /constructs
defined? Are they convincing?

How will the research contribute to existing
knowledge? (How effectively does it draw on
previous research findings or reference
existing academic debates?)

---

# The Research Design

Is the research design
explained and
justified?

Does it allow the
research questions or
hypotheses to be
answered effectively?

---

# Research Sample

How was the sample selected
and recruited?

What is the make-up of the
actual sample? Does it reflect
the intended sample?

Are strengths and limitations of
the sample acknowledged?

How effectively will data from
this sample answer the research questions or hypotheses?

---

# Data Collection Methods

Are the methods of data
collection likely to
generate data to answer
the research questions
effectively?

Are the limitations as well
as the strengths of the
methods explained?


How rigorous was the methodological approach?

---

# Mixed Methods Studies

Is there a convincing justification for using a mixed
methods approach to the research question?

How well has the design been explained in terms of
the purpose, priority, and sequence of methods?

How well has each method been presented in terms
of sampling, data collection and analysis?

How effectively have the methods been integrated?

Are there any limitations of one method associated
with the presence of the other method?

O’Cathain, Murphy, and Nicholl (2008)

---

# Ethics

Is there a discussion of ethical
issues?

Any concerns about
informed consent?

Has any potential for harm
to participants been
acknowledged or
addressed?

Reference to ethical
standards/guidelines?

---

# Data Analysis

How have the data been
analysed?

Are the processes of analysis
described fully? Are they
convincingly rigorous?

Do they make suitable use of
the data collected?

Is it clear how analytical
themes were derived from the
data?

---

# Research Findings

Quantitative Research 

Are the findings reliable?
(If you ran the research again would you
get the same findings?)

Are they valid?
(Do they measure/evaluate what was
intended?)

Are they generalisable?
To what extent can the findings applicable
across other populations?


Qualitative Research

Are the findings dependable?
(stability and consistency of research
approach)

Are they credible?
(Are they believable?)

Are they transferable?
To what extent can the findings be applied
to other situations?

---

# Research Conclusions
– Are the conclusions justifiable
in light of the research
findings?
– Do they answer the research
questions?
– Are other conclusions possible
/considered?
– Are claims to generalisability
appropriate?
– Are there any stakeholder
interests that may have shaped
the conclusions of the
research?
– Are the strengths and
limitations of the research
acknowledged?

---

Wrap-Up

The Effect readings for next week are a bit more methods and design—they're about quantitative data and quantitative relationships. They're a quick intro to what people are talking about when they say distributions, correlations, and controlling for variables. It may seem odd to focus on linear models, but as it turns out, most things in applied quantitative research are well approximated by linear models.
