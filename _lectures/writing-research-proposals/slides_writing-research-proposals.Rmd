# Know Your Audience

Before you start, you need to ask...

* What proposals do they accept?

   * *Would my research even be considered?*

--

* What are their expectations and requirements?

   * *When is it due?*
   * *What information do I need to provide?*
   * *How must it be formatted?*
   * *Do I need a sponsor or supervisor?*

--

* Who is going to read the proposal?

   * *Experts in your field—or another?*
   * *An interdisciplinary committee?*
   * *Lay people or public officials?*

# Seven Questions

## What is it all about?

.pull-left-40[

&zwj;**Goals:**

* Hook the reader!
* Define primary practical or theoretical problem
* Highlight importance

### Example

> Neighborhood disorder is also
highly-correlated with crime rates, which has led to a **significant controversy** in the social sciences
over the proper interpretation of the correlation. Does the correlation reflect a causal relationship, in
which social and physical disorder increases the likelihood of norm-violations and crime, as broken
windows theory suggests? Or does the correlation reflect a spurious relationship, in which the
correlation disappears when the confounding variable, neighborhood collective efficacy, is
controlled? The answer to this question has **important theoretical and policy implications**. This
project examines this controversy using mixed methods: field experiments embedded in
neighborhoods that are diverse on measures from the U.S. Census and the Seattle Neighborhoods
and Crime Survey.

## What do we already know?

.pull-left-40[
&zwj;**Goals:**
* Demonstrate knowledge
* Set up questions or "gap"
* Show relevance and value

&zwj;**Approach:**
* Describe past findings
* Compare and contrast
* Be critical

.pull-right-60[

### Example

Using literature review to "set yourself up":

> A feature of recent research on broken windows, collective efficacy, and social capital is that it
uses a variety of research designs, including household surveys within neighborhoods, systematic
social observation, and field experiments. Viewed separately, these research designs have specific
strengths and weaknesses involving causality, endogeneity, and external validity. By embedding a
series of experiments within neighborhoods, we hope to capitalize on the unique strengths of distinct
methods and overcome many of their weaknesses.

## What do we need to find out?

.pull-left-40[

&zwj;**Goals:**

* Anchor the proposal
* Make reader hungry for answers

&zwj;**Approach:**

* State research questions
   * Usually around 3–8
* Link back to lit review
* Be clear and concise

### Example

From a proposal for three papers:

> 1) Changing Exposures: How does exposure to guns and gun violence as well as gun use vary throughout childhood, adolescence, and early-to-mid adulthood? How has it changed over the last 25 years? In particular, how do exposures differ by cohort and race?<br>
> 2) Changing Risk and Protective Factors: To what extent have the main individual, family, and community risk and protective factors of gun violence evolved and changed over the last 25 years?<br>
> 3) Consequences: What are the long-term consequences of personal victimisation and exposure to neighbourhood gun violence for mental and physical health and criminal involvement, and how do they vary by race?

## How will we get this information?

.pull-left-40[
&zwj;**Goals:**
* Demonstrate you know appropriate methods
* Convince reader of feasibility
* Recognize potential challenges and discuss how they will be addressed

&zwj;**Describe:**
* How you will collect data
* How much data
* Specific analysis techniques

### Example

Specific but with some "wiggle room":

> For the first objective, measuring changing exposures, Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) will be used to estimate growth curves of stability and change in probabilities of reporting four measures of exposure: (1) carrying a concealed firearm, (2) shooting or shooting at someone, (3) being shot or shot at, and (4) seeing or hearing someone else get shot or shot at. Growth curve analyses will also be used to examine neighbourhood exposure to gun violence—defined as the annual rate of shootings in the participant’s neighbourhood from official police records. Analyses will also examine how variation by age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) in exposure to gun violence interact with historical change.

   * Time
   * **People!**
* Realistic timeline with milestones
   * Data collection

## What will be the benefits?

   * Clear deliverables
* Who will benefit and how?

### Example

> The research is intended to produce three peer-reviewed journal articles, one focusing on each of the three research questions of the proposed study, targeted at outlets such as *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, *Criminology*, and *The Lancet*. Findings will also be disseminated in accessible briefs for policymakers and practitioners, which the lead applicant has experience preparing, as well as op-eds and blog posts such as *The Conversation*. Finally, the data will be archived in a public repository, and code used to prepare the data and conduct analyses will be made publicly available on the applicant’s GitHub site. This will ensure research transparency and facilitate replication and extension of the research products by other researchers.

## Dissemination

Example dissemination activities:

* Internal seminars
* Regular reporting to stakeholders (e.g., health service, industrial partner)
* Publications (e.g., journal articles, reviews, book chapters)
* Conference presentations
* Outreach and public engagement
