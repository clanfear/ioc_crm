# Criminological Research

&nbsp;

# Joining a conversation

Criminology is an ongoing conversation

--

To contribute to the conversation, you need to know:

* What the conversation is about
* What the current state is
* What its premises are

--

This requires understanding of **theory** and **methodology** and *how they relate to each other*

--

This understanding allows us to...

* Ask good **research questions**
* Develop good **research designs** to answer them
* Evaluate others' research

---

# Good Research Questions

What makes a research question *good*?

--

* It is empirically <strong>answerable</strong><sup>1</sup>

   * It is in some sense factual
   * It is identifiable *in principle*

.footnote[[1] What answerable *means* is subject to epistemological debate.]

--

* It improves our understanding of the world (i.e., it **informs** theory and/or practice)

   * An answer would change how we think or behave
   * An answer would solve a significant problem

--

&nbsp;

.text-center[
*These are subjective: You must make an argument!*
]

---

# Sources of Questions

* **Theory**

   * We have expectations—are they correct?
      * *I think these expectations are wrong!*
   * Are there competing expectations from different theories?
      * *Adjudicate between them!*

--

* **Ignorance**

   * We have no expectations!
   * True scientific ignorance is **very rare**<sup>1</sup>
      * Usually: "is $x$ like $y$?" (back to theory!)
      * Almost never: "nothing is like $x$"
   * Must make convincing argument no extant theory applies

.footnote[[1] Criminology, like other social sciences, is plagued with reinvention of the wheel, due to rewarding the appearance of novelty.]

--


.text-center[
*In either case, you're probably going to need to read a **lot**.*

# Types of Questions

* **Description** - What does this look like?

   * *How do crime rates differ across neighbourhoods?*
   * *How does exposure to violence vary over the life course?*

--

* **Exploration** - What is going on here?

   * *Do violent neighbourhoods have different interpersonal networks?*
   * *Are children exposed to violence more likely to carry guns?*

--

* **Explanation** - Why is this happening?

   * *Do strong interpersonal networks reduce neighbourhood violence?*
   * *Does childhood victimization increase gun carrying?*

--

* **Evaluation** - Does this work?

   * *Does creating a neighbourhood organization reduce violence?*
   * *Does this child victims' program reduce gun carrying?*

--

.text-center[
*Each of these requires a different research design!*
]



---

# Research Design


**Research design** is *strategy* for answering research questions:

* What data are needed
* How to obtain those data
* How to analyze those data
* How to interpret results

--

**Good research design** is that which can answer your (good) research question

--

There are many different types of empirical research design

The type you choose is determined by your *question*

---

# Descriptive Research

* Accurate and systematic description of something

--

* Can take many forms, e.g.:

   * **Incidences** and **prevalences**

      * *How often do Americans witness gun violence?*
--

   * **Processes**

      * *How are police stop records generated?*
--

   * **Experiences**

      * *How do incarcerated women experience reintegration?*
--

<br>

.text-center[
*Description is the foundation of science: We must know **what** before we can explain **why***
]

.text-center[

# Exploratory Research

* Building insight into a phenomenon with limited data or expectations

   * No theory testing or causal claims
   * *Is there something interesting going on here?*
   * *When does this thing occur?*

--

* Often similar to descriptive research, but searching for:

   * **Meanings**
      * *How is offending related to decision-making processes?*
   * **Potential explanations**
      * *Are officers convicted of misconduct different than others?*
   * **Predictions**
      * *What are risk factors for witnessing gun violence?*

--

* Often used to develop explanatory questions

   * *Which of these risk factors are causes?*
   * *Do these meanings cause behaviour or are they a result of it?*

# Exploratory &#8800; Atheoretical

**Reminder:** *There is no atheoretical research*

> Theory is never completely isolated from problems of empirical research, any more than empirical research is free from theoretical assumptions (Layder 1994:vi)

> Theory is inextricably involved in the process of data-gathering and data-interpretation (Bottoms 2007:75)


--

Research makes assumptions about:

* What is worth studying
* What questions to ask
* How to measure
* How to analyze
* What counts as evidence

---

# Explanatory Research

* What causes $y$? What does $x$ cause?

   * *Why did US gun violence increase in 2020?*
   * *Does perceived risk of apprehension reduce offending?*

--


.pull-left[
* **Deductive**

   * Start with a **theory**
   * Collect data to test it
   * e.g., hypothesis testing
]

--

.pull-right[
* **Inductive**

   * Start collecting data
   * Develop **theory** from data
   * e.g., grounded theory

# Explanatory Process

---

![](img/home-free.jpg)

.text-center[
*Does residential change reduce recidivism?*
]

---

# Evaluation Research

* Is this intervention or policy *effective*?

--

* Even if you can answer this question, you still might not be able to explain *why*
   
   * Data may not be collected on what turns out to be important *later*
   
   * E.g. Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment
      * Arrest reduced domestic violence—but not in replications
      * Research design doesn't reveal *why*

--

* Explanatory research often done after or during evaluation research

   * Interviews and observations (e.g., mechanism examinations)
   * Secondary data analysis (e.g., heterogeneity tests)

## Aside: Correlation &#8800; Causation


We often hear correlation doesn't imply causation, which is true

## Aside: Correlation &#8800; Causation

We know correlation doesn't imply causation


More problematic: Causation can occur without correlation


--

![:width 80%](img/car_example.PNG)

--

* Correlations tell us nothing about causes without theory
* Be careful extrapolating from exploratory results
* Beware research conflating association and causation

# Qualitative

*Contextual, categorical, interpretive, inductive*

Data

* Interviews
* Observation (Overt/Covert)
* Participation (Overt/Covert)
* *Non-numeric*

.pull-left[
Strengths

* Access hidden populations
* Capture context and meaning
* Observe mechanisms
* Easier to communicate
]

.pull-right[
Challenges

* Research time requirements
   + Scales poorly
* Subjectivity at forefront
* Risk and access
* Replication / Generalizability
]

---
# Quantitative

*Abstract, numeric, hypothetical, deductive*

Data

* Surveys
* Secondary data
   + Police Data
   + Government Data

--

.pull-left[
Strengths

* Replication / Generalizability
* Testing and validating
* Measuring effects
* Scales well

# Mixed Methods Research

> Research in which the investigator collects and analyses
data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using
both qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods
in a single study or program of inquiry (Tashakkori and
Creswell 2007:4)

--

.pull-left[
* Intellectual and practical synthesis

* Common in applied research

* Qualitative data analysis helps:

   * Make sense of observations or statistical data
   * Guide the formulation of hypotheses to be tested
   * Provide evidence for mechanisms

]

.pull-right[

]

# A Methodological Toolbox

Some *specialization* is necessary but overspecialization is limiting, both *intellectually* and *professionally*. It is important to be able to:

--

* **Interpret** findings of any kind

--

* **Collaborate** with others with different specialties

--

* **Critique** research using any approach

> And another good reason to have a strong – and more importantly, eclectic – methodological skill‐set is so that you will not have to define (and therefore confine) yourself as either a quantitative or qualitative criminologist (although some people enthusiastically embrace such labels). You can instead call yourself a criminologist and be safe in the knowledge that you have command of whatever methodological “tool” you will need to answer whatever criminological question you have decided to ask.

# Causality

Scientific *theories* are *causal explanations* about how the world works

* $y$ occurs because $x$

Thus all explanatory research is *causal research*

--

Quantitative half of CRM emphasizes **causality**:

* Does $x$ make $y$ happen?

--

Causality isn't necessarily about numbers, nor factors that are physical, behavioural, or even *directly* observable:

   * *Meanings* can be cause actions
   * Experiences can cause *meanings*

--

.text-center[
*But what is a cause anyway?*
]

---
# Causes and Mechanisms

A **cause** is something that can initiate a **mechanism** to produce an effect

* $x$ causes $y$ via the mechanism of $z$

--

A **mechanism** is a *process* linking input to output under specific conditions

* *How a cause **works***
* Theories specify mechanisms
* Mechanisms are typically not directly observable

>  the hallmark of modern science is the search for lawful mechanisms behind the observed facts, rather than the mindless accumulation of data and the mindless search for statistical correlations among them. (Bunge 2004)

# Testing Theories

The typical (deductive) process:

1. Start with research question
2. Generate hypothesis
   * A theory-based **falsifiable** prediction
3. Test hypothesis using data
   * Quantitative statistical hypothesis testing
   * Qualitative interpretation
4. Re-evaluate theory

# Broken Windows


An Observation: *Serious crime is more common in neighbourhoods with disorder, such as litter, panhandlers, and loitering youth*

--

The Broken Windows Thesis:

.pull-left-60[
* Offenders interpret disorder as a sign of low social control (mechanism)

   * *If no one stops littering or pan-handling, no one will stop robbery or drug dealing*
   
* Offenders are thus more likely to commit crime

A Proposition: At the neighbourhood level, disorder *causes* crime

# An Experiment

Keizer et al. (2008): *Does seeing disorder make individuals more likely to commit a crime?*

--

.pull-left-60[

* Leave a money-filled envelope dangling from a postbox

* Record whether passersby mail or steal the envelope

* Add litter or graffiti and repeat

* Compare rates of theft
