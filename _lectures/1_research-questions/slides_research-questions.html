# Criminological Research

&amp;nbsp;

![:width 75%](img/london-police.jpg)

# Joining a conversation

Criminology is an ongoing conversation

--

To contribute to the conversation, you need to know:

* What the conversation is about
* What the current state is
* What its premises are

--

This requires understanding of **theory** and **methodology**

--

These lead us to:

* Ask good **research questions**
* Develop good **research designs** to answer them

---

# Good Research Questions

What makes a research question *good*?

--

* It is empirically answerable&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

   * It is in some sense factual
   * It is identifiable *in principle*

.footnote[[1] What answerable *means* is subject to epistemological debate.]

--

* It improves our understanding of the world (i.e., it informs **theory**)

   * An answer would change how we think or behave
   * An answer would solve a significant problem

--

&amp;nbsp;

.text-center[
*These are subjective; research questions require **justification***
]

---

# Sources of Questions

* Theory

   * We have expectations—are they correct?
   * Often theories offer differing expectations
      * Adjudication makes for compelling questions!

--

* Ignorance

   * We have no expectations
   * True scientific ignorance is rare&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
      * Usually: "is `\(x\)` like `\(y\)`?"
      * Almost never: "nothing is like `\(x\)`"

.footnote[[1] Criminology, like other social sciences, is plagued with reinvention of the wheel, partly due to rewarding (the appearance of) novelty.]

--

.text-center[
*In either case, you're probably going to need to read a lot.*

# Sources of Data / Research

* Academic researchers

* Contract researchers

* Government and related departments

   * Ministry of Justice
   * Home Office,
   * Youth Justice Board
   * Inspectorates

* Campaign Organisations

   * Prison Reform Trust
   * Howard League

???

Critical evaluation of sources---agenda determines what they research

---

# What knowledge is generated?

* Descriptive statistics

* Risk and protective factors 

* Explanations / Explanatory Frameworks

* Descriptions

* Interpretations

* Critiques


---

&gt; Expert, research-based knowledge about crime and criminals
still competes with views of the subject which are not
‘criminological’ in their style of reasoning or their use of
evidence. Judges, moralists, religious fundamentalists, and
populist leader-writers still offer views on criminological
subjects which are quite innocent of criminological science.
Unlike physics or even economics, which have established a
degree of monopoly over the right to speak authoritatively
about their subjects, criminology operates in a culture which
combines traditional and scientific modes of thought and
action. Intuitive, ‘instinctive’, common-sense views about
crime and criminals are still more persuasive to many –
including many in positions of power and authority – than
are the results of carefully executed empirical research’
(Garland, 2002:23)

???

Unlike many disciplines, there's both a lot of interest and no monopoly on authority

Have to engage with political and moral views of public

Deterrence example: Science says harsh punishment doesn't do much, but public and politicians go to it and it is popular to do so

---

# Criminological Topics

* Offending (e.g., opportunity)

   * Incidence and distribution of criminal behaviour
   * Causes or correlates of criminal conduct
   * Clinical studies of individual delinquents
   * Ethnographies of deviant groups

--

* Consequences of crime (e.g., victimizaton)

   * Victim studies
   * Physical and mental wellbeing
   * Intergenerational transmission

--

* Responses to crime (e.g., policing and incarceration)

   * Penological studies
   * Monitoring and evaluation of criminal justice
   * Social control
   * Criminal law&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


.footnote[[1] Importantly *defines* what is crime in legal terms]

---

# Research Design

Social science research is about understanding how the world works

--

Good **research design** is that which can answer good research questions

--

There are many different ways to approach topics

---

# Types of Research

* Description (‘what does this look like?’):

   * How do crime rates differ across neighbourhoods?
   * How does exposure to violence vary over the life course? Over historical periods?

--

* Exploration / interpretation (‘what is going on here?)

   * How do residents feel about crime in their neighbourhoods?
   * Are children exposure to violence likely to have other negative experiences and outcomes?

--

* Explanation (‘what explains or accounts for?’)

   * Do strong interpersonal networks reduce neighbourhood crime?
   * Does being exposed to violence in childhood make young adults more likely to carry weapons?

--

* Evaluation (‘what works?’)

   * Does creating a neighbourhood organization reduce crime?
   * Does a violence reduction program for at-risk young adults reduce weapon carrying?

---

# Descriptive Research

Many different forms of description

--

* Extents or prevalences

   * How many prisoners have mental health problems?
   * How many probation staff say that their morale is affected by having to fulfil targets?

--

* Processes

   * What are the dynamics of court cases? Who does what, at what point?
   * How does a youth become a gang member?

--

* Experiences

   * How do female prisoners experience release?
   * How do crime victims feel about testifying in court?

---

# Exploratory and Interpretive Research

* Building insight into phenomenon with limited existing data

--

* Often to develop research questions for explanatory research

--

* Few expectations about what you might find

   * No ‘hypotheses’
   * Broad questions

--

* Often similar to descriptive research, but searching for:

   * Understanding
   * Meaning
   * Potential explanations

---

# Explanatory Research

* Why does a phenomenon occur?

* What is the result of a phenomenon?

--

* Deductive

   * Start with a theory
   * Collecting data to test it
   * i.e., hypothetico-inductive model

--

* Inductive

   * Start collecting data
   * Developing theory from data
   * e.g., grounded theory

---

# Evaluation Research

* Is this intervention effective?

--

* Even if you can answer this question, you still might not be able to explain *why*
   
   * Data may not be collected on what turns out to be important *later*
   
   * E.g. Minneapolis DV Experiments
      * Arrest worked in reducing domestic violence
      * Replication studies found mixed results
      * Research design can't test why

--

* Explanatory research often done after or during evaluation research

   * Interviews and observations (e.g., mechanism examinations)
   * Secondary data analysis (e.g., heterogeneity tests)

---

# On Research and Theory

&gt; Theory is never completely isolated from problems of empirical research, any more than empirical research is free from theoretical assumptions (Layder 1994:vi)

&gt; Theory is inextricably involved in the process of data-gathering and data-interpretation (Bottoms 2007:75)

---

![:width 70%](img/bottoms.png)

???

Strengths or limitations aren't about validity; recognition what they do and what they do not do

Divides are not clean here---these are ideal types

Don't pigeonhole yourself into a category

Also recognize that researchers from very different approaches aren't *wrong*, they have different perspectives

---

# Qualitative and Quantitative Research Methodologies

### Distinct but complementary

&amp;nbsp;

![:width 45%](img/quant_qual_loop.svg)

---

# Quantitative Methodology

* Has philosophical roots in positivism (and post-positivism) and the natural sciences

--

* Distinction between scientific issues and normative ones

--

* Emphasis on:

   * Enumeration
   * Explanation
   * Prediction
   * Intervention

--

* Interest in 'laws', patterns, generalisations

--

* Hypothetico-deductive framework

   * Derive hypotheses from theory
   * Test hypotheses using data

---

# Quantitative Methods

* Survey data analysis

* Experiments and quasi-experiments

* Psychometrics

* Text mining

* Meta-analyses

---

# Qualitative Methodology

* Rooted in a broadly interpretivist and constructivist positions

--

* Emphasis on interpretation, e.g.:

   * How reality is understood and constructed
   * How power is exercised

--

* Interest contextual understandings

   * Prioritizes meanings over measurement and prediction

--

* Inductive and deductive analysis

   * Flexible and adaptive methods of data generation
   
---

# Qualitative Methods

* Interviews

* Ethnography and participant observation

* Focus groups

* Document and discourse analysis

* Case studies

---

# Mixed Methods Research

* Intellectual and practical synthesis:

&gt; Research in which the investigator collects and analyses
data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using
both qualitative and quantitative approaches or methods
in a single study or program of inquiry’ (Tashakkori and
Creswell 2007:4)

--

* Common in applied research

--

* Qualitative data analysis helps:

   * Make sense of observations or statistical data
   * Guide the formulation of hypotheses to be tested

# Truths and Representations

&gt; Most research studies in the social sciences involve
rather abstract concepts or constructs devised by
the researcher or other members of the
discipline, like intelligence, wealth, class, social
mobility, knowledge of a language. This means
that to investigate a problem, based on an
abstract idea, a way of measuring that idea is
going to be required. This will mean devising or
selecting a measuring 'instrument' that will
constitute an operational (observable) definition
of this abstraction (Black, 1993:14-15)

&gt; Without the 'correcting influence' of
ethnographic or participant observation
approaches, it is all too easy for those studying
crime to lose their sense of reality and begin to
perceive offenders not as people, but merely as
‘problems’ or ‘numbers’ (Maguire, 2007: 149)

&gt; Curiosity has itself to be
under scrutiny while being
exercised; we must not be
directed towards
understanding other
problems by inhibiting
observation of our own
curiosity (Bion, 1976)

---

# Hierarchies of Knowledge

&gt; In any system of ranked groups, participants take it
as given that members of the highest group have the
right to define the way things really are. And since …
matters of rank and status are contained in the
mores, this belief has a moral quality. … Thus,
credibility and the right to be heard are differently
distributed through the ranks of the system (Becker, 1967: 241)

# Thinking about Research Quality


---
# Research Aims

Does the author convince us of the relevance and topicality of the research?

--

Relevance for:

* Theoretical understanding

* Policy development

* Practice

--

*How well does the study contribute to existing knowledge?*

---

# Research Questions

* What are the key research questions/ hypotheses?

* How well are they justified? 
   * Do they respond to gaps theory?
   * Do they inform policy or practice?

* How clearly are the key concepts /constructs defined? Are they convincing?

* How will the research contribute to existing knowledge?

   * How effectively does it draw on previous research findings?
   * How does it reference existing academic debates?

---

# The Research Design

* Is the research design explained and justified?

   * Is it described in full detail?
   * Does it reference standards?

* Does it allow the research questions or hypotheses to be answered effectively?

   * Do the methods match the questions?

---

# Research Sample

How was the sample selected and recruited?

What is the make-up of the actual sample? Does it reflect the intended sample?

Are strengths and limitations of the sample acknowledged?

How effectively will data from this sample answer the research questions or hypotheses?

---

# Data Collection Methods

Are the methods of data collection likely to generate data to answer the research questions effectively?

Are the limitations as well as the strengths of the methods explained?

How valid is their measurement strategy?

How rigorous was the methodological approach?




---

# Mixed Methods Studies

Is there a convincing justification for using a mixed methods approach to the research question?

How well has the design been explained in terms of the purpose, priority, and sequence of methods?

How well has each method been presented in terms of sampling, data collection and analysis?

How effectively have the methods been integrated?

Are there any limitations of one method associated with the presence of the other method?

O’Cathain, Murphy, and Nicholl (2008)

---

# Ethics

Is there a discussion of ethical issues?

Any concerns about informed consent?

Has any potential for harm to participants been acknowledged or addressed?

Reference to ethical standards/guidelines?

---

# Data Analysis

How have the data been analysed?

Are the processes of analysis described fully? Are they convincingly rigorous?

Do they make suitable use of the data collected?

Is it clear how analytical themes were derived from the data?

# Causality

---
# Causality

Scientific research is about understanding how the world works

--

Scientific *theories* are causal *explanations* (beliefs) about how the world works

* `\(y\)` occurs because `\(x\)`

--

Quantitative half of this course emphasizes **causality**

* Does `\(x\)` make `\(y\)` happen
* If we do `\(x\)` what happens to `\(y\)`?

--

Causal approaches usually follows **hypothetico-deductive** framework

--

Causality isn't necessarily about numbers, nor factors that are physical, behavioural, or even *directly* observable:

   * *Meanings* can be cause actions

   * Experiences can generate *meanings*

???

My own theoretical work drags routine activity and ecological theories kicking and screaming into what Bottoms calls active-subject socially-oriented criminology—but my approach is generally quantitative.

# Broken Windows


Serious crime is more common in neighbourhoods with disorder⁠—litter, panhandlers, and loitering youth

--

.pull-left-60[
Broken windows thesis:

* Offenders see disorder as a sign of low social control

   * If no one stops littering or pan-handling, no one will stop robbery or drug dealing
   
* Offenders are thus more likely to commit crime

# An Experiment

Keizer et al. (2008): Does seeing disorder make individuals more likely to commit a crime?

--

.pull-left-60[

* Leave a money-filled envelope dangling from a postbox

* Record whether passersby mail or steal the envelope

* Add litter or graffiti and repeat

* Compare rates of theft

]

Wrap-Up

The Effect readings for next week are a bit more methods and design—they're about quantitative data and quantitative relationships. They're a quick intro to what people are talking about when they say distributions, correlations, and controlling for variables. It may seem odd to focus on linear models, but as it turns out, most things in applied quantitative research are well approximated by linear models.
