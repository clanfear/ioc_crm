# Causality (in Brief)


$X$ causes $Y$ if changing *only* $X$ would change $Y$

--

&zwj;This is quite broad:

* $X$ is typically not the only cause

   * e.g., $X$ and $Z$ can both be causes of $Y$

--

* $X$ may cause $Y$ for multiple reasons

   * e.g., $X$ may cause $Z$ which causes $Y$ ( $Z$ is a *mechanism*)

--

* $X$ may only cause $Y$ in certain contexts

   * e.e., $X$ may cause $Y$ only when $Z$ is present

--

.text-center[
*All that matters for the relationship to be causal is that changing the distribution of $X$ would result in a different distribution of $Y$*
]

--

We call the process of estimating a causal effect **identification**

---

# Theory and Causes


All scientific theories are causal: *They explain **why** things happen*

--

In criminology:

* "Increasing the perceived risk of being caught reduces the likelihood of a person committing a particular crime"
* "Increasing a person's self-control reduces their involvement in all crime"
* "Learning violent definitions of situations increases a person's likelihood of using violence"
* "Strong social institutions in neighbourhoods reduce crime."
* "Reducing interactions between potential offenders and targets reduces crime in places."

--

These are all testable, causal propositions about how the world works

--

Theory testing is **causal inference**: Drawing *causal conclusions* from data

* Doing this convincingly requires identifying causal effects



---

# The Problem

Let's say we want to know if we can reduce crime by clearing vacant lots

* We want to identify the effect of lot clearing on crime

--

But we only see *one outcome* per lot:<sup>1</sup>

* If we clear a lot, we don't see what happens if we had not.
* If we *don't* clear it, we don't see what happens if we had.

.footnote[[1] This is often called the "fundamental problem of causal inference"]

--

We call whichever outcome we don't see a **counterfactual**—it is counter to the fact of what actually happened

--

Causal effects are *differences* between these **potential outcomes**:

1. What actually happened, which we see (factual)
2. An alternative, which we do not observe (counterfactual)

--

.text-center[
*How do we calculate a difference when we only see one outcome?*
]

---

# Between Comparison

.pull-left[

We could compare two lots:

* **One not cleared (T=0)**
* .strong-blue[One cleared (T=1)]


And use the difference in crime (bT) as a causal effect

]
.pull-right[
![:width 80%](img/lots.svg)
]

--

&nbsp;

*But what if the difference is because the lots are different?*

--

* We could compare only lots that look *identical*

--

*But, if those lots are identical, why did one get cleared and not the other?*

* We might have missed an important difference
* We wouldn't be sure unless we knew *why* each lots get cleared

---

# Within Comparison

.pull-left[

We could compare the same lot:

* **Before clearing (T=0)**
* .strong-blue[After (T=1)]

And use the before-and-after crime difference (bT) as a causal effect

]
.pull-right[
![:width 80%](img/lot.svg)
]

--

&nbsp;

*But what if the crime change was going to happen anyway?*

* The clearing simply coincided with the crime change
* Worse, maybe the change in crime *caused the clearing*

--

*Or, what if the lot was cleared **because** it would make a difference here?*

* What if there would be no difference for *other* lots?

---

# Potential Outcomes

.pull-left[
All of these problems are really one problem:

*Differences in **potential outcomes** between cleared and uncleared lots*
]

.pull-right[
![:width 80%](img/potential_lots.svg)
]

--

These problems are resolved if the potential outcomes for cleared and uncleared lots are *the same on average* (unrelated to the treatment)

The average difference in outcomess then provides an unbiased estimate of the causal effect (the estimand)

--


.text-center[
*How do we make sure the cleared and uncleared lots are the same?*
]


---

# Randomization

*Randomized controlled trials do this*

* Take a relatively large number of lots
--

* Randomly assign treatment: clear some lots but not others
--

* On average, cleared and uncleared will be similar *in every way except for clearing*

--

Randomization makes treatment **independent** of potential outcomes

* Clearing is equally likely no matter how much a lot would benefit

--

If we randomly assign a treatment, we can estimate a causal effect as the average difference in outcomes between treated groups

* We call this the **average treatment effect**
* You can calculate this with a *cross-tab*

--

.text-center[
*What if we're interested in things we can't randomly assign?*
]

---

# Back to the DGP

When we can't **randomize**, we need to **theorize**

--

We need to figure out the **data generating process** for our treatment and outcome

* What makes some units get treated?
* What makes treatment more (or less) effective for some units?

--

This requires making **assumptions**, which are part of your **model**

* $Z$ is unrelated to $X$
* $B$ only causes $Y$ through $C$

--

.text-center[
*If our model is correct, it tells us exactly how to identify the causal effect we want*
]

--

.text-center[
*So how do we make the model?*

# Causal Graphs

.pull-left[
Classic statistics is mathy, using things like this:

$$Y = f(X,Z)$$
... to say $Y$ is caused by a combination of $X$ and $Z$

We're going to work with graphs instead:

```{tikz dag-1, fig.width = 3, cache = TRUE}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning}
\definecolor{black}{HTML}{000000}
\tikzset{
    > = stealth,
    every node/.append style = {
        draw = none,
        scale = 3
    },
    every path/.append style = {
        arrows = ->,
        draw = black,
        fill = none,
        scale = 1,
        line width = 1.5mm
    },
    hidden/.style = {
        draw = black,
        shape = circle,
        inner sep = 1pt
    }
}
\tikz{
    \node (Y) at (0,0) {$Y$};

    \node (Z) at (5, -2) {$Z$};
    \path (X) edge (Y);
    \path (Z) edge (Y);
  }
```

]

--

Directed acyclic graphs have pretty simple rules:

* Arrows between variables point from causes to outcomes (directed)

--

* No arrow means no (direct) causal relationship

--

* Something can't cause itself... *even through other things* (acyclic)

--

.text-center[
*Causal graphs are a way to write out a model that tells you how to identify effects*

# Paths

.pull-left[

A "path" is any set of arrows linking two variables together

There are three paths from X to Y:

* $X \rightarrow Y$
* $X \leftarrow Z \rightarrow Y$
* $X \rightarrow W \leftarrow Y$

]

--

Let's say we want to know the effect of $X$ on $Y$

* Paths where all arrows point from $X$ to $Y$ are called **front doors**
* Paths where arrows point to both $X$ to $Y$ are **back doors**
* Paths where arrows point *at* each other are **colliders**

--

We estimate effects *through front doors* by closing *all back doors*



---

# Closing Back Doors

Variables that open back doors are called **confounders**

* Confounders cause *dependence between treatment and potential outcomes*

--

We close doors by **adjusting** or **controlling** or **holding constant** variables along the path in statistical models<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] We'll see this in a bit]

--

.pull-left[

Adjusting for Z closes the back door

The only remaining path is the front door we're interested in

The effect of $X$ on $Y$ is identified

The *total* estimated effect of $X$ on $Y$ will be the sum of all paths leading between them.

---

# Colliders

Colliders are the *opposite* of back door paths: They *block* associations from going down their path

--

If you control for a collider on the path between $X$ and $Y$, it opens the association back up and *introduces bias*

--

.pull-left[

Adjusting for Z closes the back door

But here we've adjusted for $W$ too

This introduces bias!

# Use of Force


&zwj;Question: *Do US police use more force against black civilians?*

--

Imagine you sample police encounters **identical** except for race

*But* suppose bias leads police to:

 * Stop white civilians only for crimes
 * Stop black civilians with or without crime

--

Then, discard data on anyone police observed but *did not stop*.

You are now comparing use of force between two groups:
   
* White people committing crime
* Black people committing no crime *or* committing a crime

--

If use of force were the **same**, *we'd have a serious problem*

--

*This is what police data actually show: we only see the stopped people!*

&zwj;Question: How does race impact use of force?

We could compare how often force is used on white vs. black subjects

# The Problem

&nbsp;

&zwj;Problem: Race impacts likelihood of stop, but *we never see unstopped people*

* We've conditioned on *being stopped*—a mediator!
* We've blocked part of our front door!

--

If police stop black subjects for more minor things, then an equal proportions of use of force *actually indicates bias*

&nbsp;

More problems

* Racial composition varies by neighborhood
* Police deployments and strategy vary by neighborhood
* Reasonable suspicion predicts both stops and use of force--and can't be observed


---
# Consequences

* Detecting bias in the decision to stop is difficult

--

* If any stop bias exists, it is difficult to measure bias in...

   * Arrests
   * Use of force
   * Frisks
   * Shootings

--

* Raw numbers can easily show *opposite patterns* from underlying reality.

* Studies showing no bias—or anti-white bias—get *lots* of media, social media, and political traction.

# No Graphical Model

Making a DAG is least clear when the authors provide no graphical representation of the model at all<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Or when you're developing something new yourself!]

--

The process:

* Record all the core variables they use

   * e.g., self control

--

* Make note of causal statements

   * e.g., "self control **influences** crime by..."
   * Make these into arrows!

--

* Try to reconcile circular paths

   * Consider temporal order
   * Consider cross-level mechanisms

# Estimating Causal Effects

Once you have a DAG, it is remarkably easy to proceed to an estimator

--

1. Figure out what you can and cannot measure

--

2. If your measures let you close all back doors...

   * Adjust for back door variables
   * Don't adjust for colliders or mechanisms
   * Estimate the causal effect

--

3. If you can't close all back doors, either...

   * Close what you can and estimate association
      * Might be *close* to identified!
   * *Give up*
   * **Get clever**

# Regression Again

So far we've just fit a simple straight line using one variable predicting another

.pull-left[
```{r}
lm(crime_rate ~ pop_density, data = communities) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
  select(Term = term, Estimate = estimate) %>%
  mutate(Term = case_when(
    Term == "AreaUrban" ~ "Urban",
    TRUE ~ str_to_title(str_replace(Term, "_", " "))
  ),
  Estimate = round(Estimate, 2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Term)) %>%
  pander::pander()
```


]
.pull-right[

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
communities <- 
  read_csv("https://clanfear.github.io/ioc_iqa/_data/communities.csv")
ggplot(communities, aes(x = pop_density, y = crime_rate)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Pop Density", y = "Crime Rate") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Multiple Predictors

When we add predictors, we are **adjusting** or **controlling** for them to identify the effect we're interested in

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

lm(crime_rate ~ area + pop_density, data = communities) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>%
  select(Term = term, Estimate = estimate) %>%
  mutate(Term = case_when(
    Term == "areaUrban" ~ "Urban",
    TRUE ~ str_to_title(str_replace(Term, "_", " "))
  ),
  Estimate = round(Estimate, 2)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Term)) %>%
  pander::pander()
```

New interpretation:

* "The association between density and crime, adjusting for the type of area*"
* "The average crime rate difference for urban areas, compared to rural ones, adjusting for population density"
